These two concepts are foundational for calculating probabilities when assuming each event in the event space *has the same probability of happening*. Typical examples are rolling a dice (if the dice is \"fair\", the chance of throwing each number between 1 and 6 is 1/6) and flipping a coin (1/2 heads vs tails). You'll get a better sense of how all of this works in this lab.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","* Calculate probabilities by using relative frequency of outcomes to event space\n","* Use Python to demonstrate the axioms of probability\n","\n","##  Sample space, event space and the law of relative frequency\n","\n","#### a.

It should be clear that we get a more accurate number for P(E) when $n$ grows.\n","\n","Let's see how this works. First, let's randomly generate values between 1 and 6. You can use `numpy` (imported as `np`) to generate random integers between 1 and 6 by setting the correct arguments. The `np.random` module is a very useful tool for this.
